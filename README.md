## Overview
This repository hosts the code for the paper: Zheng WL, et al. (2022). Automated EEG-based prediction of delayed cerebral ischemia after subarachnoid hemorrhage. *Clinical Neurophysiology, 143*(97-106). [DOI: 10.1016/j.clinph.2022.08.023](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinph.2022.08.023). PMID: 36182752; PMCID: PMC9847346. The repository outlines a comprehensive pipeline for processing EEG data from raw EDF files to predict delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) using both the baseline model and max carry forward model described in the paper, as well as for the visualization of results. The pipeline details all steps from data preprocessing to final model evaluation.

## Abstract
**Objective**: Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is a leading complication of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and electroencephalography (EEG) is increasingly used to evaluate DCI risk. The goal of the paper is to develop an automated DCI prediction algorithm integrating multiple EEG features over time.
**Methods**: Assess 113 moderate to severe grade SAH patients to develop a machine learning model that predicts DCI risk using multiple EEG features.
**Results**: Multiple EEG features discriminate between DCI and non-DCI patients when aligned either to SAH time or to DCI onset. DCI and non-DCI patients have significant differences in alpha-delta ratio (0.08 vs 0.05, p < 0.05) and percent alpha variability (0.06 vs 0.04, p < 0.05), Shannon entropy (p < 0.05) and epileptiform discharge burden (205 vs 91 discharges per hour, p < 0.05) based on whole brain and vascular territory averaging. Our model improves predictions by emphasizing the most informative features at a given time with an area under the receiver-operator curve of 0.73, by day 5 after SAH and good calibration between 48â€“72 hours (calibration error 0.13).
**Conclusions**: The proposed model obtains good performance in DCI prediction.
**Significance**: Leveraged machine learning to enable rapid, automated, multi-featured EEG assessment and has the potential to increase the utility of EEG for DCI prediction.


## Pipeline Steps


### Step 1: EEG Data Preprocessing
- **Input**: Raw EEG file (.edf format).
- **Process**: Read raw EEGs, save available channels, filtering, artifact reduction.
- **Output**: Processed EEG files (.mat) stored in './Preprocessed'.
- **Purpose**: Prepare raw EEG data for feature extraction. This is a preprocessing step that can also be done by commercial softwares under your own choice.


### Step 2: Feature Extraction
- **Input**: Processed EEG files from Step 1.
- **Process**: Extraction of 7 global features performed on bipolar signals. the global features are :'Shannon', 'AlphaDeltaRatio', 'TotalPow', 'DeltaPow', 'ThetaPow', 'AlphaPow', 'PercentAlphaRatioVariability'.
- **Output**: .mat file for each EEG, stored in './Features'.
- **Purpose**: Derive meaningful metrics from EEG data.


### Step 2b & Step2c: Spike Feature Extraction
- Spike detector output from Westover lab--SKIP THIS STEP.
- These steps are for spike (you can modify this part for your spike pipeline, if applicable), current file unmodified and unused.


### Step 3: Merge Features
- **Input**: Features from previous steps (from './Features') combined with patient info.
- **Output**: Global feature matrix of all patients.
- **Purpose**: Merges 7 global eeg features with spike features from every patient's .mat  to a single.mat; calculate feature_score - the weights based on artifact detection


### Step 3v: Visualization - Cumulative features
- **Input**:  Global feature matrix of all patients.

- **Output**: Heatmap representation and line plots of distribution for two groups on global features under selection.


### Step 3b: Remove Samples after DCI
- **Input**: Global feature matrix of all patients, Vascular feature matrix, Asymmetry feature matrix combined with patient info.
- **Output**: Three new feature matrix.
- **Purpose**: Remove value after DCI onset time to 'NaN'.


### Step 4: Generate Vascular & Asymmetry Features
- **Input**: Features from previous steps.

### Step 5A: Align Features with DCI one-to-multiple
- **Input**: Features and DCI event data from patients' info, ctrl_matchtime_dci.mat.
- **Output**: Aligned feature set.
- **Purpose**: Align features to DCI onset for each patient, for non-DCI patient, a one-to-multiple match was set up (ctrl_matchtime_dci.mat), where one DCI patient will have multiple non-DCI patient match who have recordings in the same time frame aligning to SAH. Control_matchtime_dci.mat from previous published Jenn's method. (Jenn's method/paper method)
